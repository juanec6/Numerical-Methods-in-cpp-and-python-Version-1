# Numerical-Methods-in-cpp-and-python-version-1

The purpose of this repository is to show how **numerical methods** can be implemented in **C++** to provide iterative results and in **Python** for visualization and analysis.  

This repository covers:  
- Root finding methods (Bisection, Newton–Raphson, Hybrid methods)  
- Linear systems of algebraic equations (direct and iterative methods)  
- Interpolation, extrapolation, and approximation  
- Numerical derivatives and integrals  
- Ordinary differential equations (ODEs)  
- Partial differential equations (PDEs)  

⚠️ **Important:**  
- This version only works on **Windows OS** due to a C++ library used. It will not run on macOS.  
- Each method includes a **C++ file** (for calculations) and a **Python file** (for visualization). Both must be in the same folder.  
- Compile the C++ code first, then run the generated `.exe` file. The `.exe` will call the Python script for plotting.  
Example line to adjust in your environment:  
```cpp
system("\"C:\\Path\\to\\Python\\python.exe\" VisualizationBisectionMethod.py");
````
